# AstroLocator
Once upon a time I was thinking what would happen if I would end up in place, under clear night sky, where is no GPS or any other signal and I wouldn't have any idea how did I get there. I thought then I could look at the sky and find the most recognizable constellations. When I would find or no, any familiar stars I could tell on which hemisphere I am. That's already something, but I would want something better than this. I realized that I have phone in my pocket, which has three things which I need: camera, much computing power and accurate clock. I would have found app on smartphone named: ``Astrolocator''. I would fired it up and took picture of sky. After 3 hours of patient waiting I would finally know, where I am (more or less, at least I would know that I'm in Europe). \\
I have made program which take photo of night sky with stars and time when it was taken. This application returns approximation of your localization: latitude and longitude in degrees.
